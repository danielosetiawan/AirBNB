I work from home and I presently reside at this listing and I am available to answer any of your questions. My children are all grown up (this was not their home) and now I'm in a new space, I want to share it with interesting honest people. 

 My home is very clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, you cannot rent out my entire home and my yard is accessible. My home is also very secured and I have a few surveillance cameras and secure locks on all doors and windows. My neighborhood is a family neighborhood. Lots of large families live on this street. It has been a noisy summer, due too the fact these people CANNOT AFFORD VACATIONS OR TRAVEL, SO THEY HANG OUT AT HOME. Now since it that time of year where the children go back to school, the neighbor hood will become quiet again.

Now in my home there are seven rooms. You will have access to the first and second floors, unless your party requires my additional space, then the third floor can be used. I am very open to children and I have two heavy duty twin air mattresses (which are quite comfortable) and a spare bed in my office on the third floor if need be. (Pictures are not available due to this area being my private quarters!) And I do not have any pets, but I am open to small animals if they are house broken and will not destroy my home.

As my guest, I ask that you respect my things and my privacy and I will do the same. I love people and hope by opening up my home I get to meet some new life long friends! I promise you a comfy safe place and good whole foods! 

(And for parents of young people under 25, they WILL NOT have access to any alcohol. My bar is closed and locked! Just so you'll know and can feel at ease. There will no be consumption at my house!)

I am co-hosting this humble abode with my mother, Catherine Luke.  We have lived in the Southward section of Newark, NJ since the early '80s.  Our current interests are traveling, shopping, teaching (in various public high schools in the city of Newark, New Jersey), cooking, attending church every Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), movies, music, and medicine.  Our ethnic origin is Nigeria, and we take pride in our culture. We love wearing our native culture clothes and also cooking many of the staple dishes from there (jollof rice, fried rice, moi moi, akara, suya, pounded yam, etc).

I am co-hosting this humble abode with my mother, Catherine Luke.  We have lived in the Southward section of Newark, NJ since the early '80s.  Our current interests are traveling, shopping, teaching (in various public high schools in the city of Newark, New Jersey), cooking, attending church every Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), movies, music, and medicine.  Our ethnic origin is Nigeria, and we take pride in our culture. We love wearing our native culture clothes and also cooking many of the staple dishes from there (jollof rice, fried rice, moi moi, akara, suya, pounded yam, etc). A fun fact about Catherine is that she has been to several European countries during the '90s in order to sell many of the native clothing that is a staple in our country. I have been to London, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, Austria,  etc.  We are devout Christians and believe that God is the centerpiece of our life; he has been good to us.

I'm originally from Costa Rica.   My Grand parents moved from Jamaica to  Limon, Costa Rica to work on building a railroad  to San Jose 100 years ago.
Limon and Costa Rica are very friendly places.  So, is Irvington, NJ, USA.

I’ve made it so that you feel at home just as much as I do. Most of my time is spent here crafting & creating.

At the moment I split my time between New Jersey and Boston, Massachusetts and focusing more on being an entrepreneur rather than finding work. I truly love the Airbnb concept and hope to have listings all over the world some day :). I also have a car rental business that works on a similar platform as Airbnb called TURO. 

I am very interested in all Asian cultures and love meeting people from that part of the world. I hope to live there some day.  My family is from Ecuador and I have double citizenship for United States and Ecuador.

At the moment I split my time between New Jersey and Boston, Massachusetts and focusing more on being an entrepreneur rather than finding work. I truly love the Airbnb concept and hope to have listings all over the world some day :). I also have a car rental business that works on a similar platform as Airbnb called TURO.

I was born and raised in Elizabeth, NJ and know the area very well, this is where most of my listings are located 5 minutes from EWR Newark Liberty International Airport. 

At the moment I split my time between New Jersey and Boston, Massachusetts and focusing more on being an entrepreneur rather than finding work. I truly love the Airbnb concept and hope to have listings all over the world some day :). I also have a car rental business that works on a similar platform as Airbnb called TURO.

At the moment I split my time between New Jersey and Boston, Massachusetts and focusing more on being an entrepreneur rather than finding work. I truly love the Airbnb concept and hope to have listings all over the world some day :). I also have a car rental business that works on a similar platform as Airbnb called TURO.

We have an excellent support team for great stays  and nice places! 
We add new things  weekly...

I made it from NYC (Port Authority 8th Ave and 42 Street to Irvington with bus # 107X in 20 minutes when there is little traffic. 

Also,  We provide excellent WiFi and 2 WIFI networks at each house.

You may want to try downloading ROKU app for use on our Roku smart TVs.

We use door codes.  No keys needs.
We change codes after each guest leaves.

I'm giving you $5 off each of your first 4 Uber rides. To accept, use code 'marioc2038ue' to sign up. Enjoy! Details:  uber site  and  invite  and marioc2038ue

I'm originally from Costa Rica.   My Grand parents moved from Jamaica to  Limon, Costa Rica to work on building a railroad  to San Jose 100 years ago.
Limon and Costa Rica are very friendly places.  So, is Irvington, NJ, USA.

We love to provide excellent service and to excel in everything we do.

Mike is Bayonne born and bred. After moving away for college and living in other towns, he decided to head back to his hometown to plant roots and raise his family. Living on the same block that he grew up on, this history buff and storyteller can give you the low down on Hudson county just as easily as telling you the best ways to get around. 
Alicia is an expat who grew up in South Louisiana and moved across the country to marry her soulmate, Mike! She didn’t leave behind her Southern charm or sassy class though, but she is Bayonne proud and loves her hometown.

Hello, and welcome to our home. My husband and I would be so happy to host you in our newly constructed Jersey City condo. We both share a huge passion for travel, and we have been blessed to live and visit many places all over the world. Chris and I decided to root ourselves in the city that has so much to offer which is Jersey City. While settling here, we decided to give our fellow travel lovers a place that feels like home. With southern hospitality in our roots, we have a deep love for hosting, and we look forward to extending that love and warmth to our new friends.
Our modern, sun-drenched condo offers a tranquil vibe, which is perfect to come home to after a long day of exploring the city. This location is perfect for families who want to visit Jersey City  or New York area. The location is prime for any sports enthusiasts as we are a quick fifteen-minute drive to MetLife stadium—home of the New York Giants and New York Jets. The area is also suited for travel healthcare professionals, as we are near many hospitals including Jersey City hospital. Newark international airport is a quick twelve-minute drive and in thirty minutes you are in the BIG APPLE! New York City.

I wanted to open my space to others:  a unique space to enjoy the NYC metropolitan area.  There is so much diversity, culture, food, and experiences to enjoy.  

I'm an easy going  and love to travel, meet new people and enjoy the world. I often travel for work, thus leaving my apartment available to guests visiting the area (Jersey City, New York City, Newark, etc.)

I joined AirBnB as it seemed to be a perfect fit for my lifestyle & the flexibility that it offers both guests and hosts. For fun, my favorite things in the world are traveling abroard, music, theatre arts, live stand up comedy and NBA Basketball. I especially love the outdoors, camping and clear blue water with white sand beaches.

I have a passion for doing new things, and this is why I decided to host on Airbnb.   I hope by sharing my space: your trip is made just a little more enjoyable.  Have an AMAZING Day!
