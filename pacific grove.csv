Whether it’s new foods, places to visit or experiences, we love the adventure of life.  Most of all, we love time with each other, our kids, family and friends.  

We were lucky enough to purchase the home of John Steinbeck, American author and Pulitzer Prize winner, and have poured our labor of love in renovating these 100 year-old cottages.  Pacific Grove is our home away from home.  Kevin spent a lot of time writing his first book, A Life Worth Living, in our cottages - what a fantastic place for literary inspiration!

When Steinbeck resided here he formulated the plot of The Grapes of Wrath, and wrote several books including The Sea of Cortez.  This is the home he shared with his second wife, Gwyn Conger, who would become the inspiration for the lead antagonist, Kate Trask, in his epic novel, East of Eden.  In a letter to a friend, Steinbeck wrote of the cottages, “It is a pleasant little house, and we miss it… You’ll find you get a lot of thinking done in that house.” ' (from John Steinbeck, A Life in Letters).

About Us:
I have had the pleasure of living in Pebble Beach for the past 30 years after living in Albuquerque which I miss dearly, and raised in Buffalo, NY, a great place to grow up and learn to be hardy.   It’s been a wonderful mix of worlds.  
After moving to Pebble Beach we build the guest house with the intent of having our parents live with us, so there was a lot of love put into its design and special features.  I had the pleasure of having my Mom, Hope, live with us for 12 years.  We always enjoy having company over and now what better way to meet new friends and share the beauty of this area than to offer our guest home to you.  
As a host I hope to make this your home away from home.  I want our guests to feel free to come over for anything they might need or to visit and share a glass of wine.

Up to this point, we are offering more than 18 properties in the Bay Area and California Coastal area. Each property has its unique interior design and furniture layout. My goal for each property is to provide the most comfortable stays and amazing experience for all of my guests.  

When I travel, I always stay at Airbnb properties. I personally have very high expectations when staying away from home and I hope all my properties meet yours, knowing you are traveling away from your home. My team members include my partner, Carrie, a customer service crew, a cleaning crew and a repair / handyman crew. They are on call 7-days a week at your service. We strive to exceed expectations to all of our guests with the utmost respect and respond. We will ensure each property is thoroughly cleaned with enhanced cleaning protocols, and with fresh bed sheets, towels, and bath rugs upon your arrival. 

I hand picked all of the furniture, bed sheets and kitchen equipment for each of our properties. I want to make sure everything my guests use is high quality with a unique style to allow them fully enjoy the space, because my guests deserve the best!

I am also an active member of Airbnb.org which is a non-profit organization started by the founders of Airbnb. In a daily basis, I donate a certain percentage of my revenue from each guest's booking to Airbnb.org. Our mission is to unlock the power of sharing space, resources, and support in times of needs!

Since 2017, I joined Airbnb as a host and managed my first Airbnb property. Ever since then, I have never stopped creating more and more unique homes for my Airbnb guests. Up to this point, we are offering more than 18 properties in the Bay Area and California Coastal area. Each property has its unique interior design and furniture layout. My goal for each property is to provide the most comfortable stays and amazing experience for all of my guests.  

When I travel, I always stay at Airbnb properties. I personally have very high expectations when staying away from home and I hope all my properties meet yours, knowing you are traveling away from your home. My team members include my partner, Carrie, a customer service crew, a cleaning crew and a repair / handyman crew. They are on call 7-days a week at your service. We strive to exceed expectations to all of our guests with the utmost respect and respond. We will ensure each property is thoroughly cleaned with enhanced cleaning protocols, and with fresh bed sheets, towels, and bath rugs upon your arrival. 

I hand picked all of the furniture, bed sheets and kitchen equipment for each of our properties. I want to make sure everything my guests use is high quality with a unique style to allow them fully enjoy the space, because my guests deserve the best!

I am also an active member of Airbnb.org which is a non-profit organization started by the founders of Airbnb. In a daily basis, I donate a certain percentage of my revenue from each guest's booking to Airbnb.org. Our mission is to unlock the power of sharing space, resources, and support in times of needs! We partner with the worldwide communities to open housing in emergencies in order to  provide shelters for people who lost their homes. 

Thank you! My team and I look forward to hosting you in the near future!
